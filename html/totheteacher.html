<div class="cls001ClsTxt2">It is a grammar book. It does not deal with other aspects of the language.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt4">It is for elementary learners. It does not cover areas of grammar which are not<br/>normally taught at elementary level.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt7">It is a reference book with exercises. It is not a course book and is not organised<br/>progressively.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt10">It is addressed to learners and intended for self&#8211; study.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt11">Organisation</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt12">There are 115 units in the book, each one focusing on a particular area of grammar.<br/>The material is organised in grammatical categories, such as tenses, questions and<br/>articles. Units are <span class="span15">not</span> ordered according to difficulty, and should therefore be selected<br/>and used in the order appropriate for the learner(s). The book should <span class="span15">not</span> be worked<br/>through from beginning to end. The units are listed in the <span class="ured">Contents</span> and there is a<br/>comprehensive <span class="ured">Index.</span></div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt21">Each unit has the same format consisting of two screens. The grammar point is<br/>presented and explained on the first screen and the corresponding exercises are on the<br/>second. There are seven <span class="ured">Appendices</span> dealing with active and passive forms, irregular<br/>verbs, short forms (contractions), spelling and phrasal verbs. It might be useful for<br/>teachers to draw students&#8217; attention to these.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt31">After the units there is a set of <span class="ured">Additional exercises</span>. These exercises provide &#8216;mixed&#8217;<br/>practice bringing together grammar points from a number of different units (especially<br/>those concerning verb forms). There are 35 exercises in this section and there is a full<br/>list <span class="ured">here</span>.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt39">There is also a <span class="ured">Study guide</span> to help students decide which units to study.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt40">Level</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt41">The book is for elementary learners, i.e. learners with very little English, but not for<br/>complete beginners. It is intended mainly for elementary students who are beyond the<br/>early stages of a beginners&#8217; course. It could also be used by low&#8211; intermediate learners<br/>whose grammar is weaker than other aspects of their English or who have problems with<br/>particular areas of basic grammar.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt48">The explanations are addressed to the elementary learner and are therefore as simple and<br/>as short as possible. The vocabulary used in the examples and exercises has also been<br/>restricted so that the book can be used at this level.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt52">Using the book</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt53">The book can be used by students working alone (see <span class="ured">To the student</span>) or as<br/>supplementary course material. In either case the book can serve as an elementary<br/>grammar book.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt59">When used as course material, the book can be used for immediate consolidation or<br/>for later revision or remedial work. It might be used by the whole class or by individual<br/>students needing extra help and practice.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt63">In some cases it may be desirable to use the information in the explanation screens<br/>in class, but it should be noted that these have been written for individual study<br/>and reference. In most cases, it would probably be better for teachers to present the<br/>grammar point in their preferred way with the exercises being done for homework. The<br/>explanation page is then available for later reference by the student.</div>
<div class="cls001ClsTxt70">Some teachers may prefer to keep the book for revision and remedial work. In this case,<br/>individual students or groups of students can be directed to the appropriate units for<br/>self-study and practice.</div>
